# Netflix-Data-Alanysis
 This project explores the Netflix dataset to analyze trends, distributions, and insights related to the movies and TV shows available on the platform. Using Python and data visualization tools, we uncover key metrics, such as content distribution, genre popularity, ratings, and trends over time, to provide a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's content library.
